This project implement  a classification prediction for the kaggle competition "petfinder adoption prediction": https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction using python 3, keras, scikit.

The dir is ordered as such:

/classification
	main dir. Including code with scikit's pipelines definition (@see pipelines.py), run (@see main_pipe.py), custom transformer and NN classifier.

/preprocessed
	dir for preprocessed features. Preprocess some extra features to be merge to dataset. Include metadata from Google API. Transfer of a pretrained CNN on the images. Translation of description.

/tf_test
	outdated. Rapid hand on with keras.

/sk_bench
